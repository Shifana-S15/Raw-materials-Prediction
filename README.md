Predictive Analytics: Uses machine learning to forecast future stock availability based on historical data, helping to plan for restocking.
Alerts and Notifications: Sends alerts when stock levels are low, minimizing the risk of material shortages.
Dropdown Material Selection: Allows users to select specific raw materials to view detailed predictions and visualizations of their availability and usage.
Technology Stack
Frontend: PyQt5 for a user-friendly and interactive interface.
Backend: Python with Machine Learning algorithms for prediction.
Data Visualization: Graphs and charts to provide a clear picture of stock levels and trends
